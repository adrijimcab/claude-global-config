### Language Domain Contract

- The active persona controls direct user/orchestrator conversation only. Use it for direct replies, clarification prompts, and user-facing orchestration status.
- Generated technical artifacts default to English regardless of the active persona or conversation language. This includes tasks, code comments, UI copy, tests, fixtures, and delegated outputs.
- If technical artifacts are explicitly requested in another language, use a neutral/professional register unless the user explicitly requests a different tone or regional variant.
- Public/contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; otherwise use a neutral/professional register unless the target context clearly calls for another tone or regional variant.
- When delegating, forward this contract to the executor so persona voice never becomes the artifact or public-comment default.

### Delegation Rules

These rules select execution topology, not the implementation method. Implementation runs as **direct inline** or **delegated direct** under ODD; the Task Size section in the routing block selects the topology, and file count never does.

Core principle: **does this inflate the parent context without need?** If yes, use one bounded worker. If no, do it inline.

| Action | Direct inline | Delegated direct worker |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Decide/verify within the inline evidence budget | ✅ one bounded batch | — |
| Understanding beyond the inline evidence budget, or long sequential exploration | — | ✅ one read-only explorer, then re-evaluate task size |
| Read as preparation for a delegated write | — | ✅ together with the write |
| Write a small task (one understood change, any number of files) | ✅ | — |
| Write a large (tracked) task with no Write rule reason | ✅ following its logbook | — |
| Write a unit with a Write rule reason | — | ✅ one bounded writer per unit |
| Bash for state (`git`, `gh`) | ✅ | — |
| Focused test and suite of the change being made | ✅ once each | — |
| High-risk change, or long suites, builds, installs, or native review actions of a large task | — | ✅ independent verifier or fresh per-action worker |

Use Claude Code's native Agent/Task mechanism for delegated-direct work. Summarize any needed handoff explicitly.

Pass the authorized edit surfaces, acceptance criteria, the applicable test-first policy and runner from `## Implementation Routing`, applicable verification commands, and relevant prior context explicitly to bounded implementation workers. Workers preserve unrelated working-tree changes and return observed outcomes and checks.

Keep each delegated writer bounded, with a short synthesized handoff. Delegation is mandatory only when a mechanism's own trigger fires.

#### Delegation Triggers

These are parent-orchestrator routing boundaries. Each trigger holds only when its condition truly holds, and only then is it mandatory; no trigger holds by default, and when in doubt work inline. Use the smallest useful topology and keep the safety machinery behind the outcome-first interaction. Do not pass these rules to child agents as permission to orchestrate.

1. **Evidence budget rule**: decide or verify inline with one parallel batch, at most 3 calls and approximately 10k tokens. Use bounded search/line ranges, not whole large files.
2. **Mapping rule**: understanding that needs more evidence or more than approximately 5 sequential lookups requires one read-only explorer; with its handoff, re-evaluate task size. Return at most approximately 2k tokens with path:line evidence and one parent spot check. Do not reread the entire mapped evidence.
   - Keep parent bash output bounded to counts, --stat, tail, or summaries. On a large task, delegate long suites and builds; return concise observed results, including failures.
   - The approximately 150k parent-context backstop is advisory guidance, not mechanically observed or enforced. Pause and delegate the next bounded unit; do not claim runtime telemetry or enforcement.
3. **Write rule**: a small task's writes stay inline, even across files; delegate a writer only for a named reason: parallel units launched together (two or more independent units of behavior with disjoint edit surfaces, each needing several minutes of work: several files or roughly 100+ changed lines, because a subagent spends one to two minutes reading before it writes) or the context backstop. A unit is one independent piece of behavior with its code, tests, and docs together: never split one behavior into test, docs, and code writers, and a delivery that depends on another is not independent; several small independent changes run inline, one after another. Never for size, a large task alone, file count, or a price ratio; without a reason the parent writes inline, following its logbook. File count never fires this rule.
4. **Context rule**: when the Write rule delegates a write, delegate reading that prepares a write together with it, plus broad research/context compression; an inline write reads inline, and never explore files you will read anyway before writing inline.
5. **Per-action rule**: tests, builds, installs, and native review actors may use fresh workers without changing the implementation route.
6. **Verification rule**: only a change that names a Task Size high-risk item gets an independent verifier after the change's own checks, as rarely as possible; a native tier, an unclear or failed assessment, and the writer's model or effort never add one by themselves; otherwise the change's own focused test and suite run inline.

#### Delegated Verification Gate (MANDATORY)

Verification of a delegated writer's work follows the same rule whether receipt-driven development (RDD) is on or off. After the writer returns, the parent runs `gentle-ai review assess --cwd <repo> --agent claude-code --json` (`gentle-ai.review-assessment/v1`, `risk` one of `passive`, `medium`, `high`) over the writer's diff. The independent verifier is for concrete occasions only: it runs when, and only when, the change touches a Task Size high-risk item that the parent names by adding `--escalate-item <1-6> --escalate-reason "<one line>"` to that assessment; never for size, a native tier alone, a failed assessment, or the model or effort that wrote the change.

- **Risk tier**: passive: structural readback only; medium: writer self-verification stands, with no separate verifier, whatever model wrote the change; high through a named high-risk item: writer self-verification plus one independent verifier; a native `high` without a named item, an unknown or failed assessment, or an unrecognized verb informs only: writer self-verification stands, and the parent names the item when one applies. The bounded writer runs the parent-authorized `## Verification` commands in the foreground and reports `<command>: <observed result>`.
- **RDD on**: the native review is an additional outside view of the change, from the lenses pertinent to what was touched; it never replaces or skips the tier's verification, and the tier's verifier runs before review. A runtime that renders an RDD status line reads it from there; otherwise read `gentle-ai review mode status` (read-only) and treat a failure as `unknown`. A declined consent, a disabled clone, or a refused START or STATUS changes nothing about verification.
- The parent spot check — re-running one reported command before delivery — stays in every tier.
- **Verification timing**: when several deliveries of one feature were written inline, run one independent verifier at the feature's end instead of one per delivery; verify per unit only when that unit names a high-risk item (its Risk line or the escalation over its actual diff), never because of the model or effort that wrote the code.
- **Correction bounds**: verifier blockers get one correction batch that fixes every reported blocker, then one recheck limited to those blockers, never a new full sweep. A second correction runs only when the recheck shows the same blocker still failing; a new finding never earns one. Blockers still open after that become one **Needs your decision** result. A writer's self-review follows the same bound, then reports `partial`.
- **Verify handoff**: give the verifier the whole feature document (every `S#`, never one task), the baseline commit, and the probe command forms. On its first launch the verifier runs probes in a fresh scratch copy created with `mktemp -d` under the system temp dir, never inside the workspace, and leaves no new file in the workspace. Probes derive from the specs, plus invariants: the data hash is unchanged after a rejected command, and prior commands' output is identical to the baseline. Severity: a blocker is a change-caused defect or unmet spec item that reproduces with realistic input and did not already reproduce at the baseline; defects already present at the baseline and out-of-domain values are advisories; silently ignoring an explicit option with success, or changing existing output nobody asked to change, is always a blocker. The writer commits the probes as regression tests.
- The writer receives `## Verification` naming the exact commands to run, and may receive `## Known environmental failures` naming exact test names or command lines already failing on the base as evidence; any other failing required command still forces `partial`.
- Exploration stays a separate delegation only when the parent needs the map to decide or route; reading that prepares a write belongs to whoever makes that write, and the parent never explores files it will read anyway before writing inline.

#### Native Checking Contract

- Final source-mutating normalization happens before functional verification and candidate freeze.
- **Normalization ordering rule**: before review START and its identity freeze, run every source-mutating normalizer, then re-snapshot the candidate and review those exact bytes, paths, and modes. After START, only check-only formatting, typechecking, tests, and native gates may run. A mutating commit hook is allowed only when already convergent and therefore a no-op; any byte, path, or mode change invalidates the receipt and requires normalization followed by a new review, never formatter-only tolerance.
- Native RAR owns verification applicability, risk, the bounded zero/one/four-lens plan, correction impact, and terminal receipt. The orchestrator and adapters never select lenses or author PASS.
- A passive ordinary document or image needs structural readback, not an artificial semantic-verification subagent. Active, mixed, operational, executable, mode-changing, or unknown content fails closed into the applicable native plan.
- For a trivial passive documentation-only edit, structural readback is the complete proportional check; do not open a separate semantic-verification or heavy review ceremony.
- If an applicable verifier is unavailable, preserve the typed unavailable result; never invent PASS, retry indefinitely, or escalate into extra ceremony.
- An applicable quick check runs once. Long or very-long work gets one cost/side-effect forecast before launch. Unavailable, partial, declined, or exhausted proof becomes one actionable **Needs your decision** result.
- Functional proof and adversarial review both project as **Checking**. One immutable candidate permits at most one scoped correction; there is no loop-until-clean behavior.
- Commit, push, PR, direct-main, emergency, and release gates are informational and unmanaged; ordinary repository policy decides delivery and they never reopen review for unchanged content.
