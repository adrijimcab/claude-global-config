### Mental Model

Gentle AI is an ecosystem configurator and harness layer. After installation, the user should not memorize workflows or manually wire agents. The harness should get out of the way:

- Small request: do it directly.
- Substantial authorized work: use ODD; track feature progress automatically.
- The parent session orchestrates; bounded workers execute.

Delegation is not optional once complexity appears. If a task crosses the Mandatory Delegation Triggers, use the smallest useful delegated workflow instead of continuing as a monolithic executor.

### Organic Driven Development Is The Default Workflow (MANDATORY)

Organic Driven Development (ODD) is this orchestrator's predefined workflow for every request. Its ordered protocol is installed for this agent under `## Implementation Routing` (`### ODD protocol`) and runs first, on every request, without the user asking about workflow, planning, or task tracking.
