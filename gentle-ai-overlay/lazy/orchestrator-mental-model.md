### Mental Model

Gentle AI is an ecosystem configurator and harness layer. After installation, the user should not memorize workflows or manually wire agents. The harness should get out of the way:

- Small request: do it directly.
- Substantial authorized work: use ODD; track feature progress automatically.
- The parent session orchestrates and writes inline; a bounded worker takes a unit only for a named reason.

Delegation follows named reasons, never size or complexity alone. A Delegation Trigger holds only when its condition truly holds; none holds by default, and when in doubt work inline. Once one holds, delegation is not optional: use the smallest useful delegated workflow instead of continuing past it inline.

### Organic Driven Development Is The Default Workflow (MANDATORY)

Organic Driven Development (ODD) is this orchestrator's predefined workflow for every request. Its ordered protocol is installed for this agent under `## Implementation Routing` (`### ODD protocol`) and runs first, on every request, without the user asking about workflow, planning, or task tracking.
