### Skill Registry Protocol

The parent resolves skills once per session or before first delegation:

1. Read `.atl/skill-registry.md` if present.
2. Match task context and target files against the `Trigger / description` column.
3. Pass only matching `Path` values to subagents under `## Skills to load before work`.
4. Tell subagents to read those exact `SKILL.md` files before reading, writing, reviewing, testing, or creating artifacts.
5. If the registry is absent, continue but mention that project-specific skill paths were unavailable.

Subagents receive exact indexed paths and do not rediscover the registry or additional project/user `SKILL.md` files during normal runtime.

If a subagent reports `skill_resolution`, interpret it as project/user skill resolution:

- `paths-injected`: the parent supplied `## Skills to load before work` with exact `SKILL.md` paths.
- `fallback-registry`: the subagent self-loaded skill paths from the registry because parent paths were missing; degraded but auditable.
- `fallback-path`: the subagent loaded explicit skill paths because parent paths were missing; degraded but auditable.
- `none`: no project/user skills were loaded.

If any subagent reports a fallback instead of `paths-injected`, treat it as an orchestration gap and correct future delegations by passing exact indexed paths directly.
